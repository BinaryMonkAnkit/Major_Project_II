# Intelligent Table Extraction and Conversational Insights from Documents

## Overview
The exponential growth of digital information has led to an overwhelming volume of documents that organizations and individuals must process efficiently. Traditional data extraction methods often struggle with diverse formats, complex table structures, and unstructured layouts. This project introduces an AI-powered system that automates table extraction and enables natural language interaction with document contents.

## Features
### 1. Automated Table Extraction
- Processes uploaded documents to detect and extract tables using Python-based libraries.
- Converts extracted tables into structured CSV format while preserving their original layout.

### 2. Conversational Document Querying
- Uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to allow users to query extracted document contents dynamically.
- Enables users to retrieve specific information without manual document scanning.

### 3. Support for Multiple Document Formats
- Handles PDFs, DOCX, HTML, and scanned images.
- Integrates Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction from image-based documents.

### 4. Natural Language Summarization
- Users can request document summaries or query specific sections conversationally.
- Enhances efficiency in information retrieval and decision-making.

### 5. Dynamic and Customizable Queries
- Allows users to define specific queries for targeted document sections.
- Enables customized data extraction based on user needs.

## How It Works
1. **Upload a document** – The system processes PDFs, Word files, or scanned images.
2. **Automated table extraction** – Tables are detected, extracted, and converted into CSV format.
3. **Context-based querying** – The extracted data is fed into an LLM for natural language interactions.
4. **Retrieve insights** – Users can ask:
   - "List all tables extracted from this document."
   - "Generate a CSV file for all detected tables."
   - "Summarize section 4.2 of this document."

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Efficiency:** Automates table extraction and document querying to save time.
- **Improved Data Accuracy:** Structured extraction ensures high precision in retrieving document insights.
- **User Accessibility:** Intuitive interface for non-technical users to interact with documents easily.

## Applications
This system is applicable across multiple industries:
- **Finance:** Extract financial tables, analyze reports, and query performance metrics.
- **Healthcare:** Process medical records, extract structured patient data, and summarize reports.
- **Legal:** Analyze legal documents, retrieve clauses, and summarize case files.
- **Education & Research:** Extract references, summarize research papers, and query academic documents.

## Conclusion
By integrating intelligent table extraction with conversational AI, this project redefines document processing, making information retrieval seamless and efficient. The ability to extract structured data and interact with documents using natural language represents a significant advancement in document management.
